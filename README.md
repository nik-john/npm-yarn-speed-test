After much hype, npm has finally revamped NPM and released V5. While we were waiting for npm@5, the world of dependency managers was rocked by the new kid on the block — Facebook’s Yarn. According to my crude benchmarking methodology, I found that Yarn is consistently 4.7x as fast as npm@4.
So, it is obligatory that I run some benchmarks on Yarn and npm@5.


Requirements:

Upgrade your npm to npm@5: `npm install npm@latest -g`
